Hyun Woo!

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,830
Mom... It's me, Hyeon Woo.

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>Mom, are you listening?</i>

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,030
Come quickly!!

7
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,520
I don't have battery. I only have 5% left.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,430
Hyeon Woo.

9
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,950
<i>I'll come.</i>

10
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,190
<i>Hyeon Woo, get out from there.
Get out first.</i>

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,410
<i>The door is locked. There's
a lock on the door, Mom.</i>

12
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,620
Are you with someone? How
many people are there?

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,660
One. He always comes at night.

14
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,880
Where is that person?

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,480
Are you hiding right now?

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,130
Hyeon Woo.

17
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,230
<i>Hyeon Woo, find a place and hide.</i>

18
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,690
Don't hang up for now.

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,790
Hyeon Woo.

21
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,790
It's okay. Come out.

22
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,630
<i>Hyeon Woo escaped. He's
on the phone right now.</i>

23
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,730
Mom. On the second floor, there's
a really big swimming pool.

24
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,570
There are no lights and
there's a pile of trash.

25
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,810
And? What else is there, Hyeon Woo?

26
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,750
<i>To the window.</i>

27
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,730
Is there a window?

28
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,310
Look for places that you can go out of.

29
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,780
It's too high. I can't get out.

30
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,020
Hyeon Woo, no matter what,
find a window and get out.

31
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,500
If it's locked, break it. If
you get out, ask for help.

32
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,510
<i>Jeong Reung Blue Swimming Pool</i>

33
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,150
- Hyeon Woo, what is it?
<i>- It says Jeong Reung Blue Swimming Pool.</i>

34
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,250
On the placard.

35
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,850
Hye... Hyeon Woo!

36
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,520
Hyeon Woo.

37
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,500
Hyeon Woo.

38
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,980
Hyeon Woo escaped and called us.

39
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,270
He's still in the same
building as the kidnapper,

40
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,030
It's a place called Jeong
Reung Blue Sports Centre.

41
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,440
We're leaving soon.

42
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,370
I'll do it.

43
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,300
Go in.

44
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,160
I can't see anything.

45
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,670
Second floor swimming pool.

46
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,220
- Hyeon Woo!
- Song Hyeon Woo!

47
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,120
Hyeon Woo!

48
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,010
Let's go to a different place.
Let's separate.

49
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,680
- Will you be alright on your own?
- Go quickly.

50
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,650
I'm going to the basement. If
anything happens, call me.

51
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,020
Hyeon Woo!

52
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,920
Hyeon Woo! Hyeon Woo!

53
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,790
Hyeon Woo.

54
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,040
Hyeon Woo!

55
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,740
Yeong Gwan.

56
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,490
Yes?

57
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,810
Jeong Hye In, where are you right now?

58
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,310
Are you alone?

59
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,930
Keep the phone on, if anything happens,
shout and let me know your position.

60
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,510
Hyeon Woo!

61
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,640
The third floor, opposite of the stairs.
I heard something.

62
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,320
Hyeon Woo!

63
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,870
Hyeon Woo!

64
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,450
Mom!

65
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,980
Let me see. Are you hurt anywhere?

66
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,000
Does it hurt anywhere?

67
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:37,240
Mom! Mom!

68
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,300
Mom!

69
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,130
Mom!

70
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,080
Jeong Hye In! Jeong Hye In!

71
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,780
Lee Yeong Gwan, the kidnapper
ran away with Hyeon Woo

72
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,910
through the window across the
stairs to the third floor.

73
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,440
Jeong Hye In is injured. Tell the
support staff to put up road blocks.

74
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,100
Jeong Hye In. Jeong Hye In! Jeong Hye In!

75
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,990
Are you awake?

76
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,160
Our Hyeon Woo, over there.

77
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,740
The police are searching right now.

78
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm sure they're not far.

79
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,630
<i>Blocked Number</i>

80
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,760
<i>Jeong Hye In. Let's say you
succeeded in the 4th mission.</i>

81
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,288
<i>You confirmed that Hyeon
Woo is alive right?</i>

82
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,290
<i>Go back and wait for
the next mission.</i>

83
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,830
No!

84
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,250
His name is Na Soo Hyeon, 29 years old.
Around 6:45 p.m. last night...

85
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,100
he was recorded on the UCN CCTV
after the Jo Nam Cheol's murder.

86
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,542
It's been confirmed that it was
also Na Soo Hyeon whom Jeong

87
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:42,920
Hye In saw during Hyeon Woo's
escape attempt yesterday.

88
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,820
We found the person who took Hyeon Woo.

89
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,810
Na Soo Hyeon.

90
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,150
I guess it wasn't planned for Na Soo
Hyeon to be revealed right now.

91
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,660
It was also Na Soo Hyeon who
killed Han Sol's dad, right?

92
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,130
You, Na Soo Hyeon, Park Se Yeong.

93
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,720
What relationship do you guys have?

94
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,420
You started meeting Park Se Yeong a
month before Hyeon Woo's kidnapping.

95
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,710
Na Soo Hyeon started working part
time at the cafe next to UCN,

96
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,840
two months before Hyeon Woo was kidnapped.

97
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,590
These plans, when did they start?

98
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,850
Did you find out where he lives?

99
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,120
Due to unidentifiable residence,
his ID has been blotted out.

100
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,430
What about family?

101
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,120
He doesn't have any family for now.

102
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,820
His parents died in an accident
when Na Soo Hyeon was 16 years old.

103
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,222
Nine years ago when he
enlisted in the army,

104
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,540
his six year old sister
died of an illness.

105
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,930
His brother who is four years older than
him was reported missing seven years ago.

106
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,580
The case is still left unsolved.

107
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,095
I'm sorry. Only if I had
caught him, we could've

108
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:19,150
gotten Jo Nam Cheol's testimony
and Hyeon Woo also...

109
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,430
Is it okay for you to
be discharged so soon?

110
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,369
It's okay. They just
stitched my side a few

111
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:30,600
times. They told me to be
careful moving around.

112
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,380
How could that be?

113
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,470
What?

114
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,980
Na Soo Hyeon jumped on Jo
Nam Cheol to kill him...

115
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,470
and if you tried to stop him
or at the least witness it...

116
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,640
how can you be injured so slightly?
So convenient.

117
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,420
- Jeong Hye In.
- No, no.

118
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,620
From her perspective, that could happen.

119
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,270
But everything happened so fast. Well...

120
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,680
There's no reason why Na Soo
Hyeon would want to kill Hyung.

121
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,170
As long as he wasn't interfering
with killing Jo Nam Cheol.

122
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,490
I'm sorry.

123
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,503
We have to put a show together.
Get some rest. We'll

124
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,820
go out and prepare for the show.
Take your time.

125
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,920
There's no need for that. Let's go out
together. He said to wait for the mission.

126
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,830
The mission isn't always
given to you alone.

127
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,490
Don't move on your own, and
just contact us immediately.

128
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,960
Yes, PD Sin. I have to go out. There's
been a lead on the silver ring.

129
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,689
There seems to be something.
But it can also

130
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,480
be false information, so
I'll go check myself.

131
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,910
I'll film everything said and
contact you immediately.

132
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,450
Sorry I couldn't tell you ahead of time.

133
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,120
Okay.

134

135
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,730
This is the shop I used to run.

136
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,330
I don't run the business anymore. I'm
a native from this neighborhood.

137
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,940
Now there are so many young people here.
Old fashioned ways don't work.

138
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,990
My son over there changed everything.

139
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,440
Ah, I see.

140
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,000
But about the silver ring
you called me about...

141
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,980
I can tell right away.

142
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,620
Yeong Hyeon's older brothers came
to buy it for her fifth birthday.

143
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,420
Yeong Hyeon?

144
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,210
Yeah.

145
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,440
She was a girl who lived
in this neighborhood.

146
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,680
She had two older brothers who
were much older than her.

147
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,540
Oh, there's a picture... There...

148
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,830
Here, this picture. It's this picture.

149
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,580
They were cute... all of them...

150
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,370
Without any parents, the two
boys took care of the baby...

151
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:32,340
After they went out to work,
Yeong Hyeon came here to play.

152
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,470
Do you possibly know the
names of those oppas?

153
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,740
Sure. Their surname was Na. The
older boy was named Chae Hyeon

154
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,470
and the younger one was named Soo Hyeon.

155
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,090
Na Soo Hyeon?

156
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,710
Yes.

157
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,200
Thank you. I'm going to call someone.

158
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,350
Okay.

159
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,210
Excuse me. About this... we gave
you crucial information, right?

160
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,760
Yes. Thank you so much.

161
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,040
Then how much are you giving us...

162
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,140
Pardon?

163
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,880
Last time, you gave 5 billion dollars.

164
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,180
Ah, that isn't something that I can decide.

165
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,740
There's nothing?

166
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,500
No, the police also give bounty rewards.

167
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,059
Doing this kind of
broadcast to find her

168
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:30,830
son, and she didn't think
of bounty rewards?

169
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,710
Thank you for the information.
I'll find out about the

170
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,560
thing you were talking about,
and contact you again.

171
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,690
The silver ring that was featured last
night's show... I found its owner.

172
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,350
The three siblings made it
on the youngest's birthday.

173
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,680
Hyung, Na Jae Hyeon is J. Na Soo Hyeon
is S. The younger one, Na Yeon is Y.

174
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,100
The bracelet is the baby's. Then the
ring from the container box last time...

175
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,130
Na Jae Hyeon is missing, so the
possibility that it is his is high.

176
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,399
If Jo Nam Cheol killed Na Jae Hyeon...
Na Soo Hyeon

177
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,670
killing Jo Nam Cheol is
revenge for his brother.

178
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,990
Will this help the investigation a bit?

179
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,720
Of course. Thank you.

180
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,580
But why didn't you go to the broadcast
team first, and came to us first?

181
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,950
I wanted to get your permission on
whether this can be broadcasted.

182
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,778
If it's better for catching
the criminal if it isn't

183
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,050
broadcasted, I won't
tell the broadcast team.

184
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,790
Why?

185
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,940
Our broadcast, is slowly becoming scary.

186
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,060
Even if I try to think that
this is for saving Hyeon Woo,

187
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,110
more people are dying, it's getting more
dangerous for the broadcast team...

188
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,460
But everyone wants to
make it more provocative.

189
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,300
I'm worried.

the criminal, Jeong Hye
In's Wanted team...

221

knew that the people who appear
on the show would be murdered,

You can just change the reason.

243
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,253
I'll air saying that our
decision was unavoidable

244
00:24:08,265 --> 00:24:10,600
due to police's decision
to save Hyeon Woo.

245
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,260
The broadcast team internal interview
will support that viewpoint.

246
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,870
And?

247
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,340
Shift the viewers' focus from our
broadcast team's ethics to the kidnapper.

You're something.

251
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,670
What about you? Wasn't this
your goal from the start?

252
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,710
Whichever way it went, I
wasn't going to lose out.

I gambled.

254
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,670
If you asked for a favor, you shouldn't
have caused trouble for me at the least.

255
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,440
How can you take care
of business like that?

256
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,860
I'm sorry.

257
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,530
Help me once more.

258
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,617

announce that you didn't

259
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:04,370
air it as part of your
investigative strategy.

260
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,050
Are you... asking us to take the hit?

261
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,970
For the police... that'd
put you in a better light.

262
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,510
Shouldn't you explain why you kept quiet
even after knowing about the clip?

263
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,970
We'll take care of our side.

264
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,140
Commissioner...

265
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,410
Attention.

266
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,660
It's an order that came
directly from the Commissioner.

267
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,200
Starting from now, we will not be moving
together with the broadcast team.

268
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,250
Chief.

269
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,411
Since our team was in charge of
taking care of the broadcasting

270
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:50,150
team, I'll take the hit. For
making the wrong decision.

271
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,290
Why, Chief?

272
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,620
They're cutting the tail off.
At one point, he told

273
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,020
us to assist them and not
get in the way of the show.

274
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,900
Then, what's going to happen to us?

275
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,500
I probably should take my hands
off the case completely.

276
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,773
You guys, the way you are now...
work with the new task

277
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:06,030
force the National Police
Agency will pair you up with.

278
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,100
Due to the serial murders
on "Wanted," the

279
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,630
broadcasting team will also
be up for investigation.

280
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,130
It turned out well. I'm happy with it.

281
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,340
This is the right direction.

282
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,510
The kidnapping case became a murder case.

283
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,790
It's not the job of the police to
be controlled by the criminal.

284
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,620
I'm not being involved in this.

285
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,420
I won't join the task force.

286
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,190
You, come out. Come out and talk.

287
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,460
Just let me do what I've been doing,
and stick with the broadcast team.

288
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,180
Why? You're catching the same criminal.

289
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,860
The guy you're trying to catch is the same
guy the task force is trying to catch.

290
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,270
I know...

291
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,530
But?

292
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,590
If they don't succeed in a
mission, Hyeon Woo dies.

293
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,610
Without the police, they can't solve
it in one day and on top of that...

294
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,470
What else?

295
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,710
Jeong Hye In is in a state of isolation.

296
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,420
She can't trust her husband, her
manager and the broadcast team...

297
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,660
She was abducted, got Hyeon Woo
taken away from her again...

298
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,820
She's experiencing all that alone.

299
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,380
Officially, I can't. I definitely told you.

300
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,540
Chief.

301
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,390
If you're not going to join the task force,
take care of all the backed up incidents.

302
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,650
There are tons of reports
you haven't turned in.

303
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,670
Right now, those words...

304
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,420
No, I'm not giving you time.

305
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,170
If you go to the task force, I
can't even cover for you...

306
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,170
I'm taking you out because I'm scared
you'll cause trouble and get fired.

307
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,420
Yes, I understand.

308
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,620
For now, I'm sure I'll be suspended
or be disciplined somehow...

309
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,700
If you need anything, tell me.

310
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,300
Okay.

311
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,020
What's with you now?

312
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,170
How did you finish the talk?

313
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm scared he'll cause trouble, so
I took him out of the task force.

314
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,500
Pardon?

315
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,390
Then, I...

316
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,820
You're obviously going into the task force.

317
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,880
Chief...

318
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,610
Is this true?

319
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:38,090
Geez, where can I send this baby?
Without a mentor...

320
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,470
Be sure to train him well this time around.

321
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,640
Yes.

322
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,076
Today's article can be
taken care of like this

323
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:50,900
somewhat. But how come the
mission hasn't arrived yet?

324
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,240
Why don't we prepare
what we can before then?

325
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,030
For the preview, I think this one will
work better than a mission related one.

326
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,970
We have to make a reason
for people to watch.

327
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,450
<i>Jeong Hye In. Let's say you
succeeded in the fourth mission.</i>

328
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,824
<i>You confirmed that Hyeon
Woo is alive right?</i>

329
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:10,850
<i>Go back and wait for
the next mission.</i>

330
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,473
Let's hire a voice actor,
record that, and use

331
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,840
it. I didn't have a
chance to do that yet.

332
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,910
You're going to place "Reenactment"
in the subtitle, right?

333
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,640
That can't be.

334
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,022
The purpose of this
preview is to have the

335
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:25,540
viewers' emotions get
tied into Jeong Hye In.

336
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,390
The criminal and Jeong Hye In's
two-top drama. That's what you do.

337
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,880
- Such a fabrication...
- Wake up!

338
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,616
You shouldn't have gotten
involved in this show if you were

339
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,230
going to argue and feel guilty
over every little thing.

340
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,590
Why are we doing this show?

341
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,337
If we make people realize
that we're doing this show

342
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,440
because of Hyeon Woo, there's
nothing else they can do.

343
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,785
Talk to Bo Yeon and
try to hurry it up.

344
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:52,390
Change up the voice and
make it a bit scary.

345
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,780
What?

346
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,910
No, it's nothing.

347
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,900
I thought I had to listen
to your opinion too.

348
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,480
Why?

349
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,630
Jeong Hye In... I know that you definitely
don't cry in front of other people.

350
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,240
But you have to show this appearance,

351
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,200
and if we add the criminal's
voice and broadcast it,

352
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,370
we don't know how the criminal will react.

353
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,060
What do you think?

354
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,250
As a writer or as a person?

355
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,260
As a writer.

356
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,670
Today's broadcast, no... because we
have to keep doing the broadcasts,

357
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,390
do you think it'll be of help?

358
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,640
It will be somewhat effective in
turning the public opinion around.

359
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,770
Then do it that way.

360
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,180
Make the criminal's voice scary, use
dark music. Do everything you can.

361
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,690
Not so that Hyeon Woo comes back safely.

362
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,820
There's nothing I have to protect now.

363
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,290
Strangely, you and PD Sin Dong
Wook have a lot of similarities.

364
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,660
I get it now.

365
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,220
Hello?

366
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,000
It's not very convenient right now.

367
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,440
Okay, I'll go now.

368
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,720
There's a place I have to go to urgently.
If the mission comes...

369
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,210
I'll contact you immediately.

370
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,450
It would have been nice if you told me
first, before I saw it on the broadcast.

371
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,850
Are you sure? That our Tae Yeong
didn't die in an accident?

373
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,260
Although I'm not sure,
there's a possibility.

374
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,710
To save Hyeon Woo, I have to
look into that possibility.

375
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,790
That possibility, I want to find it too.

376
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:42,840
If Tae Yeong died unjustly, I'm
going to rectify it even now.

377
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,190
Tae Yeong's son, Hyeon Woo...
I haven't even seen his face.

378
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,710
Because of the articles that exploded
today, the show could be difficult to do.

379
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,650
Our group will wholeheartedly
support the show.

380
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,890
Of course, I'll follow it and if I
find something out, I'll let you know,

381
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,130
Tell me right away if you
need anything, Sister-in-law.

382
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,510
I have alerted my legal and PR team.

383
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,070
Thank you.

384
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,820
Sunbaenim.

385
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,155
Seven years ago, the detective
who investigated Na

386
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,690
Jae Hyeon's missing case
quit during that time.

387
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,190
What is he doing now?

388
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,390
He opened up a detective agency a year ago.

389
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,638
Before that, he ran a
bar but went bankrupt.

390
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,960
Looks like he tried his
hand in this and that.

391
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,030
- You found out where he is right?
- Yes.

392
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,190
Let's go for now.

393

<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd

394
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,790
She's here.

395
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,420
What's the status of the broadcast team?<

396
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,110
How will you take responsibility for
hiding the possibility of murder?

397
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,360
Will you stop the show?

398
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,620
Do you think you can be
pardoned by finding Hyeon Woo?

399
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,370
What is the SG Group's stance?

400
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,810
Please say one word!

401
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,150
What is the current situation?

402
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,330
Please tell us!

403
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,760
One word please!

404
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,650
Please... please save me!

405
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,010
Jeong Hye In, you're here. Please save me.

406
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,610
Make it so I can be on the
show as soon as possible.

407
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,750
Who are you?

408
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,260
Jeong Hye In. I'm the 5th mission.

409
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,240
The victim of the missing case I
investigated seven years ago...

410
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,890
Please have Na Jae Hyeon
appear on Wanted today.

411
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,620
Get on.

412
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,220
Jeong Hye In, please say something!

413
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,620
Doesn't he have to go
to the hospital first?

414
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,500
I know right.

415
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,790
No, I'm okay. Let's finish talking first.

416
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,130
Please tell me what happened
from the beginning.

417
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,270
I didn't think that guy
would come find me again.

418
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,390
Because of that guy, my
life is in a shambles!

419

<i>Who made you drop Yeong Soo's case
and made you quit being a detective.</i>

423
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,590
<i>There was nothing like that</i>

424
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,410
Ah, you're quite injured.

425
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,570
Here.

426
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,930
<i>But... do you think you can
stop it next time, too?</i>

427
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,050
<i>Huh?</i>

428
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,460
<i>Your name.</i>

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,440

430
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,600
<i>Starting from now,</i>

<i>if you do what I say, I'll spare your life.</i>

<i>If you run away or call the police...</i>

433
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,770
<i>If you run away or call the police, I'll
show you the pain of losing your family.</i>

434
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,800
<i>Because not knowing that, is your crime.</i>

435
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,090
Who's the person who made you like
this and made you deliver the mission?

436
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,900
The missing Na Jae Hyeon's
brother, Na Soo Hyeon.

437
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,970
Na Soo Hyeon?

438
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,210
- Park Bo Yeon.
- Yes.

439
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,430
Call Detective Cha and
explain the situation.

440
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,480
There's not much time
until the broadcast.

441
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,410
Okay.

442
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,240
What was the reason that Na
Soo Hyeon did this to you?

443
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,530
He said I didn't search
for his hyung properly.

444
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,770
Seven years passed already...
now he comes and...

445
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,850
What was the situation under
which Na Jae Hyeon disappeared?

446
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,170
Uh that...

447
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,270
Seven years ago, Na Soo Hyeon reported
that Na Jae Hyeon was missing.

448
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,070
That was mid-September.

449
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,000
But he said that no one could contact
Na Jae Hyeon two months before that.

450
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,720
Seven years ago... What was the last day
that someone could be in contact with him?

451
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,330
July 12th. It was confirmed
that he went to work that day.

452
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,710
July 12th?

453
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,890
If it's July 12...

454
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,410
You're right.

455
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,130
The day before my ex-husband
died in a car accident.

456
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,920
<i>September 2009</i>

457
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,230
<i>So he couldn't be contacted after
July 12th and didn't come to work?</i>

458
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,910
<i>Yes.</i>

459
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,800
<i>Was there anything weird
when you last saw him?</i>

460
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,510
<i>Usually, he comes to work on a bicycle,</i>

461
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,695
<i>I saw him when I got off work.
He got into an</i>

462
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:17,190
<i>expensive foreign car in
front of our health center.</i>

463
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,520
<i>I think someone came to pick him up.</i>

464
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,630
<i>Did you see who was in the driver's seat?</i>

465
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,430
<i>No because the tint on the car was dark.</i>

466
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,420
<i>What about the car, do you
think you know the car?</i>

467
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,810
<i>Black Rolls Royce.</i>

468
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:40,510
Black Rolls Royce. Tae
Yeong used to drive it.

469
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,730
That car... there's not that
many in the country, right?

470
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:49,940
So, Na Jae Hyeon met Han Tae Yeong. And Han
Tae Yeong died in the accident next day.

471
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,260
After that, Na Jae Hyeon was missing?

472
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,820
Other owners of black Rolls Royce checked
out to be in different locations.

473
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,540
Why didn't the investigation move
forward after finding that out?

474
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,460
Detective Cha, I think you
have to come here quickly.

475
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,460
Yes, he says he was the detective in charge
of Na Jae Hyeon's missing person case.

476
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,930
Yes, I'll go immediately.

477
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,640
I'm close by, so it won't take long.

478
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,968
<i>Met Detective Go Hyeong Joon.
Stopped Na Jae Hyeon's missing</i>

479
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,460
<i>case due to pressure from superiors.
He's hiding something...</i>

480
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,955
<i>He already turned in his resignation.
How far does the connection</i>

481
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:45,200
<i>go? Need to approach this more carefully.
Kim Sang Sik</i>

482
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,980
What is that?

483
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,220
<i>"Exactly why was Detective Kim Sang
Sik following my hyung's case? "</i>

484
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,659
<i>"Also what did he find out
that he was killed by Jo Nam</i>

485
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,200
<i>Cheol? Detective, please reveal
this before it's too late."</i>

486
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,750
It's Na Soo Hyeon.

487
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,820
Why are you like this?

488
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,580
<i>Exactly why was Detective Kim Sang
Sik following my hyung's case?</i>

489
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:52,090
<i>Also, what did he find out for him
to die at Jo Nam Cheol's hands?</i>

490
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,630
<i>Detective, please reveal
it before it's too late.</i>

491
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,780
Did Detective Kim Sang Sik go to see you?

492
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,840
Let go of this. Who is Kim Sang Sik?

493
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,596
Seven years ago. I'm talking
about the detective

494
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,980
who followed Na Jae
Hyeon's disappearance.

495
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,000
I don't know that person.

496
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,210
No.

497
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,030
You know.

498
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,390
You definitely remember.

499
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,790
Talk. What did he say?

500
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:31,420
What did he find out, that
he died, you bastard?

501
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,990
Sunbae, you'll get in trouble.

502
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,970
Sunbae, you'll seriously
get in trouble. Sunbae.

503
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,296
There's no much time until the broadcast.
Whether you

504
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,710
kill him or not, do it later.
After the broadcast ends.

505
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,024
I just stopped investigating
because I got an

506
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:52,210
order from above to
stop the investigation.

507
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,280
That's it. Also,

508
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,440
there wasn't any more evidence.

509
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,063
Lee Myeong Soon who
was killed by Jo Nam

510
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:04,160
Cheol... He contacted me
to give me information.

511
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,870
that's when I took hands off the case.
A detective named Kim San Sik

512
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,138
was going around asking for details.
All I did was

513
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,580
tell him the location, so
the two of them can meet.

514
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,230
<i>Drink quickly.</i>

515
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,100
<i>- Ah seriously, I said I don't drink.
- I said not to lie.</i>

516
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,330
<i>- I said I don't drink.
- Detectives have to live properly.</i>

517
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,440
<i>I don't drink alcohol-</i>

518
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,760
<i>Sunbae, where are you going again?
You're acting weird these days...</i>

519
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,310
<i>Are you meeting someone without us knowing?</i>

520
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,820
<i>I'm going to buy cigarettes. Because
of you guys, I can't meet any girls.</i>

521
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,070
What?

522
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,830
I didn't know he would die there.

523
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,120
I was looking for Lee Myeong Soon, but
he had already ran away to Philippines.

524
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,560
I felt something might happen
to me if I continued on.

525
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,790
I quit being a detective.

526
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,100
My life is a mess thanks to Na Jae Hyeon.

527
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:54,980
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by The Wanted @ Viki.</i>

528
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,420
Let's start by finding Na Jae Hyeon.

529
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,720
About Detective Kim... Even though
it may be hard, our Hyeon Woo...

530
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,050
There is no way that
Hyeon Woo will get hurt.

531
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:17,460
Then, what do we have to do to start?

532
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:29,100
Na Jae Hyeon, from the day he met Ham Tae
Yeong, he disappeared or went into hiding.

533
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,280
That day, Ham Tae Yeong
died in an accident.

534
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,670
He wouldn't have gone into hiding.

535
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,066
If he voluntarily went
into hiding, he would have

536
00:47:36,078 --> 00:47:38,390
found a way to get in
contact with Na Soo Hyeon.

537
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,386
It seems that Na Soo
Hyeon truly started this

538
00:47:41,398 --> 00:47:44,340
terrible thing in order
to find Na Jae Hyeon.

539
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,057
Detective Go stopped
looking for Na Jae Hyeon

540
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:49,620
because of the pressure
from his superiors.

541
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,850
Jo Nam Cheol said yesterday that
there was someone behind the scenes.

542
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,890
Hold on.

543
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,640
Something's weird.

544
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:03,960
The container box from the first mission,
Jo Nam Cheol, and Lee Myeong Soon...

545
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,100
If all these incidents are connected and
there is someone behind the scenes...

546
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:15,530
Why would Na Soo Hyeon
have killed Jo Nam Cheol?

547
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:21,030
Jo Nam Chul tried to reveal that.

548
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,400
If Jo Nam Cheol killed Na Jae Hyeon,

549
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,600
wouldn't Na Soo Hyeon killing Jo Nam
Cheol be revenge for his brother?

550
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,980
Na Soo Hyeon already knew everything,

551
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,030
he didn't want Jo Nam Cheol to get
out of it without getting punished.

552
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,980
Because he knew that Jo Nam
Cheol killed his brother,

553
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,435
Perhaps he wanted to get
to the bottom of his

554
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:53,990
brother's death that
remained an unsolved case.

555
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,586
Then... saying have him
appear on the show

556
00:48:57,598 --> 00:49:01,290
doesn't mean bring Na
Jae Hyeon on the show.

557
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,070
I forgot this.

558
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,000
The corpse that Park Gwang Yeong took
care of at the request of Jo Nam Cheol...

559
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,580
<i>Seven years ago, I went
in and was asked a favor.</i>

560
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,240
<i>He told me to get rid of a corpse.</i>

561
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,330
<i>A corpse?</i>

562
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,660
<i>He said it's in a junkyard in Incheon.</i>

563
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,220
<i>I got asked on an errand to get rid of it.</i>

564
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,630
<i>I was told that if the person that killed
him found out, there would be chaos.</i>

565
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,570
<i>Did Jo Nam Cheol go to
jail for killing him?</i>

566
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,820
<i>He didn't say that, and
I didn't ask about it.</i>

567
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:54,550
The corpse that Jo Nam Cheol asked you
to get rid of, where did you bury it?

568
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,420
Ah, wow.

569
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,280
Hey.

570
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,180
My mouth caused trouble.

571
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,550
I told you that trusting you.

572
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:15,230
Only if i hadn't owed my life
to you then, Detective Cha...

573
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,380
This time, I'll owe you one.
I'll let you go next time.

574
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,180
That body... where is it?

575
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,830
Stop the show!

576
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,520
Stop, stop!

577
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,140
UCN, repent!

578
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,980
Repent! Repent!

579
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,680
End the murderous show!

580
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,600
End it! End it!

581
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,840
Don´t worry.

582
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,880
The corpse that gangster buried
would be all bones by now.

583
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,320
There's no way to prove if that was
Na Jae Hyeon or not for today's show.

584
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,080
There aren't any other ways.

585
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,750
You only need to think about two
things during this broadcast.

586
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,940
Changing the viewer's feelings
to sympathy for Hyeon Woo.

587
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:10,580
And have them on the edge of their seats
as if they're watching a thriller.

588
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,540
Dong Wook, you need to remember one thing.
Hyeon Woo's safety.

589
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,510
Park Bo Yeon.

590
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,810
Yes.

591
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,970
Press Director went to see the
detectives with a camera director.

592
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,070
Continue to be on the phone, do what I
tell you to do, and control the time well.

593
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,670
I...

594
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,530
Yes.

595
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,780
I'll shoot the video right away as soon as
we find it. So, control the timing there.

596
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,120
Do not forget that the mission's success
and Hyeon Woo's safety are the priorities.

597
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,510
Okay.

598
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,230
You have to go to that side. That's right.

599
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,900
I took out the scene where the
detectives were fighting.

600
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,250
Check it, I changed the screen too.

601
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,740
Yes, okay.

602
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,340
When you find something, call me.

603
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,410
We're starting.

604
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,170
Do not forget what we discussed earlier.

605
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,900
Everything on this show is real.

606
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,039
We're making this show
according to the request

607
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:30,940
of the kidnapper who
took my son, Hyeon Woo.

610
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:52,960
Before today´s broadcast, you
all saw the preview video.

611
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,000
Last night,

612
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,393
it was an actual footage
from the location

613
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:02,890
where Hyeon Woo attempted
a dramatic escape.

614

Woo's embrace, I was

00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,410
tasered by the criminal
and lost consciousness.

616
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,900
I...

617
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,610
Twice, I could not protect my child.

618
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:29,230
And Hyeon Woo who will
turn 7 years old soon,

619
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:34,100
was caught by the criminal who kidnaps
and kills without thought again.

620
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,330
Yes.

621
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,880
Yes, Commissioner.

622
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,290
I will do as I promised earlier.

623
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:58,530
The criminal was just a man in his 20s.

624
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,350
Na Soo Hyeon.

625
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,451
Hyeon Woo's kidnapper
and confirmed murderer

626
00:54:06,463 --> 00:54:09,080
of Professor Kim that
was reported today.

627
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,610
And most probable murder
suspect of Jo Nam Cheol.

628
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:18,140
Na Soo Hyeon lost his parents at a
young age. With his older brother

629
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,580
and younger sister, he is
known to have a close bond.

630
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:30,690
However, his younger sister died 9 years
ago. 7 years ago, his brother dissappeared.

631
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,420
If so, did these incidents turn
this young man's life upside down?

632
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:42,460
While investigating Na Soo Hyeon,
we received the fifth mission.

633
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:49,970
<i>Fifth mission Bring Na Jae Hyeon who
was missing 7 years ago onto the show!</i>

634
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:57,100
Na Jae Hyeon is Na Soo Hyeon brother
who disappeared 7 years ago.

635
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,705
Do you see the bracelet
and ring that we found

636
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:05,440
in Jo Nam Cheol's
container box last night?

637
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,000
J, S, Y.

638
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,294
The younger sister who died 9
years ago, Miss Na Yeon, the

639
00:55:15,306 --> 00:55:18,500
older brother who went missing
7 years ago, Na Jae Hyeon,

640
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,960
and Na Soo Hyeon.

641
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,875
Through the testimony of
the detective who first

642
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,850
investigated Na Jae
Hyeon's missing case,

643
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:35,300
Detective Kim who was
murdered by Jo Nam Cheol

644
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,781
was digging into a case
unofficially before he was

645
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,560
murdered. We confirmed that
it was Na Jae Hyeon's case.

646
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:47,150
<i>The criminal's older brother
Na Jae Hyeon's missing case</i>

647
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,710
What is this? What happened to the video of
Detective Cha and Detective Gong fighting?

648
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,230
The script changed too.

649
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,000
I changed it.

650
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,160
What?

651
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,510
We used Detective Cha
enough on the last episode.

652
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,540
It has nothing to do with Hyeon Woo either.

653
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,994
It changes the entire
feeling of the

654
00:56:09,006 --> 00:56:10,750
broadcast, yet it has
nothing to do with it?

655
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,810
It would have helped the continuity too!

656
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:16,682
In my judgment, it wasn't
important enough to rub

657
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:20,500
salt in someone's wound
without their permission.

658
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,690
Writer Yeon!

659
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,556
At the moment, our broadcasting
team is searching Na Jae

660
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:31,940
Hyeon's location according
to a secret information.

661
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,720
But we still haven't been
able to find Na Jae Hyeon.

662
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,770
For Hyeon Woo's safety,
before this broadcast ends,

663
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:46,180
I hope that Na Jae Hyeon can
safely appear on this show.

664
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,110
Yeong Gwan!

665
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:05,980
Yes!

666
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,570
Detective Cha.

667
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,000
Go in.

668
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,400
<i>Na Jae Hyeon</i>

669
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,480
Okay, they found him.

670
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,750
Act like we just found
him, with nervousness.

671
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:45,390
With just 10 minutes left to the end of the
show, we've found Na Jae Hyeon's location.

672
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:09,310
However unfortunately, Na Jae Hyeon is
unable to appear and give testimony alive.

673
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:16,240
On the day my ex-husband Ham Tae Yeong died
in an accident, July 13, 2009, Na Jae Hyeon

674
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,280
was last seen getting on his car.

675
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,360
Today, he has been discovered
as a skeleton in a forest.

676
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,360
Hyung.

677
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,570
Hyung.

678
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:27,240
Now we have completed the fifth mission.

679
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,527
In the beginning, the
kidnapper seemed to punish

680
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:35,750
criminals who committed
crimes against children.

681
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:41,310
Now, he has thrown a
complicated question at us.

682
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:48,860
Na Soo Hyeon, Na Jae Hyeon,
Detective Kim, and me.

683
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,070
My ex-husband's accident.

684
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,470
Indeed what could be connecting
these things together?

685
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:18,210
What are you doing? Give me a mic.

686
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,980
Before today´s broadcast ends,

687
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:41,050
As Hyeon Woo's father and UCN's CEO, I
have something to say to all of you.

688
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,570
Camera, on President Song.

689
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:50,940
Jeong Hye In, act like
you were expecting this.

690
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:05,970
Today will be the last episode of WANTED.

691
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:17,850
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by The Wanted @ Viki.</i>

692
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,261
<i>If you want to say
something, do it in my office.</i>

693
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:21,970
<i>Did you find anything in
President Song's voice transcript?</i>

694
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,770
<i>Now, you are being investigated,
Broadcasting Team.</i>

695
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:25,890
<i>Let's start with you.</i>

696
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,770
<i>We've been told to use this room from now.</i>

697
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:29,850
<i>If you're going to get out of this
investigation, get out completely.</i>

698
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,990
<i>Don't mind me.</i>

699
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,520
<i>When Jo Nam Cheol was murdered,
you were there with him, right?</i>

700
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,020
<i>Song Jeong Ho!</i>

701
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,270
<i>He must be an accomplice.
Everything fits in so well.</i>
